Images already in [\Catalog](https://github.com/laurajohann/Mineral-Fluorescence-Prediction-/tree/main/Catalog) folders, so you do not need to upload anything to get started.

If you do not want to remake the dataset with Mineral Builder, I uploaded the one I compiled in this google folder that you will need to include in [\Libraries](https://github.com/laurajohann/Mineral-Fluorescence-Prediction-/tree/main/Libraries):

When using Prediction App, after picking library, you can select specific categories to use for prediction, and enter k-value or values (you can type a list separated by spaces in which the app will pick from 
based on the highest scoring k)

So far I found that 'hue' and 'value' paired with a k-value of 100 did best (even though the calculated score was low..)
